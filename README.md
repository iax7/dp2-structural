# Design Patterns 2 - Structural

My notes from [The Ultimate Design Patterns: Part 2](https://codewithmosh.com/p/design-patterns-part2) course.

## Patterns

1. Composite
   > Represents object hierarchies where individual objects and compositions of objects are treated the same way.
1. Adapter
   > Allows converting the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.
1. Decorator
   > Adds additional behavior to an object dynamically.
1. Facade
   > Provides a simplified, higher-level interface to a subsystem. Clients can talk to the facade rather than individual classes in the subsystem.
1. Flyweight
   > Allows sharing common state between multiple objects.
1. Bridge
   > Allows representing hierarchies that grow in two different dimensions independently.
1. Proxy
   > Allows providing a substitute for another object. The proxy object delegates all the work to the target object and contains some additional behavior.
